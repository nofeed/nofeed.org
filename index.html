    <p>For the past 20 years, I have dedicated my career to refining my expertise in backend development.</p>
    <p>In the beginning, I built an E-Commerce website using PHP for a local small business that hired
      me in 2004 as their only developer.</p>
    <p>From there, I worked my way to major corporations, banks, telecoms and governments, as well as 
      several startups, providing them with my professional expertise. </p>

            <p>I worked on the 
              <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988636/annex-e-dper-faqs-digital-per.pdf" title="Prisoner Escort and Custody Services" rel="nofollow">Prisoner Escort and Custody Services</a>
              as my first project for the UK 
              government. It was a tough and demanding experience and definitely a baptism by fire, but 
              I learned a tremendous amount from it.</p>

            <p>We created a Ruby on Rails app that works together with a Node.js frontend, and also 
              developed and launched libraries to gather data about UK prisons from several 
              contractors.</p>

            <p>Throughout my involvement in the project, I single-handedly took charge of the backend. 
              I specifically engineered the API to handle file uploads, restructured the internal library
              to enable external data source retrieval, actively engaged in the development of Docker 
              images, introduced webhooks and ensured smooth maintenance of the system.</p>

            <p>I still love to think about that time. I loved working on a project that had 
              clear

              I appreciated the challenge and importance of working closely with 
              researchers who conducted user research and were deeply invested in the project.</p>

            <p>I am proud to have been a part of the top-notch security team at Funding Circle. Our team 
              <a href="https://medium.com/funding-circle/why-we-moved-to-a-cross-functional-team-a85584e81a89" rel="nofollow">comprised of Ruby and Clojure developers and DevOps experts</a>
              who collaborated to strengthen the 
              security of Funding Circle's extensive microservices ecosystem. We continuously updated and 
              improved security measures to provide the highest protection for our users' data.</p>

            <p>I've personally updated tens of Ruby applications, rewriting most Dockerfiles to follow 
              their new standards, updating all dependencies and deploying them in production. I learned 
              more about Ruby's ecosystem, designing and managing a microservice structure, organizing a 
              larger system, and exploring the exciting Clojure language.</p>

            <p>My tenure at Funding Circle stoked my enthusiasm for Docker, considerably enhanced my engineering
              know-how, and bolstered my capabilities as a DevOps professional.</p>

            <p>When Ruby on Rails first emerged as the new technology, a startup approached me seeking 
              an experienced Ruby developer to join their team, as they were having difficulty finding 
              one on their own. I was intrigued by the opportunity to work with such cutting-edge 
              technology and help this startup reach their full potential.</p>

            <p>After a year and a few releases, I was promoted to 
              <abbr title="Chief Technical Officer">CTO</abbr> and tasked with managing a team of
              young developers. Our goal was to fix a web application that had no testing and scalability
              issues. We turned it into a reliable app that can handle high traffic and serve major 
              clients such as Google, Nike, Microsoft, AT&T, and Procter & Gamble.</p>

            <p>I was responsible for all technical aspects, including growing the team, managing the 
              product, creating a scalable architecture for the application, and conducting usability tests.</p>

            <p>I adore greenfield projects, the ones I can start anew "in the right way". This one was 
              particularly interesting and useful, mixing two fields I'm deeply fond of: software 
              engineering and technical <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>.</p>

            <p>The CDDO data-catalogue is a robust search engine that enables easy exploration of 
              government APIs and datasets. It's the perfect tool for accessing departmental data 
              resources, given its wide-ranging database. With this impressive platform, users can 
              effortlessly filter and search for relevant information, thanks to its user-friendly
              interface.</p>
              
            <p>Working with user researchers and quality assurance technicians helped me grow as an 
              engineer. I faced several challenges while designing a platform for all government agencies,
              such as dockerizing it and ensuring it met the latest accessibility standards.</p>
            
            <p>The alpha release of the project on Heroku caught the attention of the project owner and 
              exceeded expectations, leading to its approval for further development.</p>
